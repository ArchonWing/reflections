1) What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

When a Git repository is initialized, a .git folder is created in the repository that stores all of the metadata necessary for version control.  This is necessary because this hidden directory is what enables Git to operate on that directory.

2) How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area is a transition area between the working directory and the repository - the working directory is the operating system level file structure, the staging area is a selection of any number of files to include in the repository, and the repository is is what Git operates on for commits, checkouts, etc...  The value of the staging area is that it allows users to only include the files they want in commits, or to add files to commits separately.
