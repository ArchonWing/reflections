When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

    You would want to use a remote repository in order to keep a backup of data, as well as enable Git's push/pull functionality for working with multiple developers on a file, or for a single developer working from a multiple locations.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Other developers may be working on different pieces of a project, whose updates might interfere with your own work.  
    By pulling changes manually, you are able to select only the pulls that won't interfere with your work, and you will also know exactly what new logical changes to expect in the code.
